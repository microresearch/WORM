	                Final Version of
                ENGLISH TO PHONEME TRANSLATION
                           4/15/85

        Here it is one last time.  I have fixed all of the bugs I
        heard about and added a new feature or two (it now talks
        money as well as numbers).  I think that this version is
        good enough for most purposes.  I have proof-read the
        phoneme rules (found one bug) and made the program more
        "robust".  I added protection against the "toupper()"
        problem some people had with earlier versions.

        If you make a major addition (like better abbreviation
        handling or an exception dictionary) please send me a
        copy.  As before, this is all public domain and I make
        no copyright claims on it.  The part derived from the
        Naval Research Lab should be public anyway.  Sell it
        if you can!
