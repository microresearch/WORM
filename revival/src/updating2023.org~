* black on gold edition with extra vocabs/maybe

** where we can fit these vocab banks in - what is spare?

there are 67 banks in first modes...

- what modes use the full sets of banks?

those which make use of newsay and newsay_lowbit

- and how we could squeeze in more? across lowbits // assess lowbits mode...

- vocabs are of different lengths but we need to keep identity of vocabs

// TODO: test extents - how many banks we can fit in?

** how we access these and know if we don't include them

- using own tools like lpcread and lpcsay (re-acquaint - wierd values in lpcread but should be fine)

- using ti_lpc which seems to guess locations well eg. for speak/math cd2392.vsm 

** other options

- bends of tables such as chirp for vocabs...

- what we work towards in raven from WORM/TMS5xxx and others...?

** is this the correct codebase or move to revival

** programming header again...

** new TMS encodings
