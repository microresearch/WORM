/* own wormy speech synth:

- also what are differences between chips such as sp0256/votrax - (see patents)

Following klatt:

- excitation - voiced/unvoiced, changes in frequency of glottal pulses, white noise...
- filtering - formants and zero poles (nasal), any tube modelling,
  open and close of mouth - see latest book

/* notes from Pickett:

 */

/* approaches:

- source/filter

-- sources: glottal impulses

- tube model
- LPC/HMM etc...
