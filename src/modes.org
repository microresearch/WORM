* MAJOR MODES 

- run down by name, files, description, manual desc, 1-SELX/2-Y/3-Z/4-SPEED, notes, TODO

** 0) TMS5220

** 1) FULLKLATT: rsyth-2.0-port, main.c


SELX- chooses which position - like X axis
SELY- chooses phoneme for that position - like Y axis
SELZ- length of phoneme at that position

*** notes

- added TRIANGULAR source from parwv.c to test-> DONE, also other changes from parwv to finish
- glitchy to fix - could be speed, msec per frame or filter later?
- that in main.c we have the SELX etc selections
- that there was a pitchbend but now where we can have it if not in another mode

*** TODO:

- how we change flutter and TLTdb(where) and Kskew?-> see in def_pars.c - what are settings for say female or different voices/vocal fry?

fill in here:

- test substitution of wavetable etc and other excitations IN
- SPEED setting to do (and maybe test interpol there)
