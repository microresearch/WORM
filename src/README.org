* ERD/WORM dirty speech synth

32k sample rate

* worming

- wormbounds x/y exerted on parameters + speed of worming z?
- worm trigger?

The WORM was for a long time desirous to speake, but the rule and
orâˆ£der of the Court enjoyned him silence, but now strutting and
swelling, and impatient, of further delay, he broke out thus... [Maier]

In contrast to other speech modules which make use of a single speech
chip or algorithm ERD/WORM implements multiple speech codecs...

for cv and knobs - as above so below.... mirroring...

++ vocoder options with different sources - square wave, white noise etc.

all modes doubled by worm - worm from base through parameter
constraints for each. trigger resets to base. thus double for each mode more or less

** xxx

*This week to have basic scheduling for klatt and knob allocations, memory. Also kind of template for other generators*

*template should be triggerable version and free-running version - mark each as such!*

** 11/11

- can we have say 128k contig memory? can use say 120k but need to assign memory to ccm if need more than 8k for other tasks

but not enuff memory in that case and can't program it (look for
larger arrays?) - set now to 32768 so can do loggy as is and can
always change loggy

will need to look into stm32_flash.ld for ccm definition - TESTed okayyyy....

eg. u16 sin_data[256] __attribute__ ((section (".ccmdata")));  // sine LUT Array

FIXED 12/11

- stmlib => fft etc. ???

so we put eg.  int16_t pWavBuffer[3840] __attribute__ ((section (".ccmdata")));

// testing now basics - why is so quiet?

// parwave is in nsynth - this handles the klatt frames

*** final 11/11 notes

- need to break down phoneme frames and/or move phoneme generation out
  of audio.c interrupt as is too long/slow - also as if we re-trigger
  fast then is only start of phoneme we hear...

  moved out of interrupt which means we have 32 samples/trigger always issue (so is 32 samples max slowed)- seems okay now

- to test all phonemes... also still question of volume to solve - HW on test board?

[- enter_phonemes() in phtoelm is executed only once? and can we bypass
  this for individual phonemes? or is case of phoneme and last one?]

/// all of rsynth is about transitions between phonemes and we just
have one - so simplify or fake this/make longer phoneme cases. see holmes.c

/BUT/and our list of phonemes is the lookup list - to figure out what we
need to send to holmes for 2nd part and simplify holmes for 1 phoneme 12/11
or do X/Y of 2 phonemes - but what of trigger? or trigger on max!

either way simplify to numericals an no string stuff/memory 

- klatt/rsynth on pc verbose to check all...-> see Downloads/rsynth-2.0 (also updated rsynth version?)

- TODO: raw klatt with certain start positions and worm off from these within parameter bounds for each

- TODO: generate and test square for vocoder

** 12/11

- fixed stm32_flash.ld CCM mistake

- retest trigger - fixed as VOLATILE

- break down rsynth - problem is if we even have 1 phoneme + stress then is ended!

so we need to open up holmes.c so keeps running and writes directly
into audio_buffer and deals with trigger/phoneme selection (is always
one phoneme behind? - but not great idea as we can't look ahead?

how do we get stress and dur from phoneme?

this is dur in phone_to_elm

if (!(p->feat & vwl))
stress = 0;
t += phone_append(elm,StressDur(p,stress));
(int) (StressDur(p, stress, islong)));
#define StressDur(e,s,l) ((e->ud + (e->du - e->ud) * s / 3)*speed)

for each one in elements.def

next bit is stress?

stress is either 0,1,2 or 3

so we have phoneme_num//dur//stress and 1/6/0 seems to be ending (twice??) *TODO* make that array which is test_elm

- also need to get rid of pwavebuffer and write straight IN DONE

- 32k=64k=128 frames

- can enlarge audio buffer now we have fixed ccm so could be 60k =
  120k = say 200 frames audio.h = 58870 with log_gen.py calculating
  end

*if we enlarge then re-do loggy for this size* DONE

*69 is number of phonetic elements - stress or no stress = 69x4=272 - close to 255???* leave stress as 0 for now

*** notes

- how does CV select phoneme - like how often do we sample CV to give
phoneme? do we have phoneme list which we run through into buffer and
shift out or? based on speed? as have it trigger is the one

- working on run_holmes which is constant running and trigger-able -
  test this and then figure out how to update list... 

- clip in nsynth *4.0f for volume increase ADDED - VOLUME fixed

- still scheduling question - say for run_holmes so doesn't just cycle
  over itself... wait until playhead passes how?

// and run_holmes seem start with phrase fine and run DOWN - if we run continuous then will tail off!

- run_holmes as 2nd mode (MODE=1)

- how does run_holmes know how much to fill buffer? - overfill?/average - silence is ok

*** TODO

- triggering and scheduling is main issue// add to end of phoneme list and shift left or just re-write (more modes?)re-write!-TODO

- mode1-run_holmes - use trigger to freeze any changes to phoneme list as extra mode-TODO

*TODO: proof tests on VOSIM(sc/braids/csound/sc-formlets),XY(bbandpass,doformantfilter, biquad), vocoder(ladspa?/mdavoc=input and
mdavocoder?/mdatalkbox/pv_vocoder=justFFTsofar), LPC(talkie and SC), canto etc.* nearly DONE

*TODO: changes suggested above//how to test-simulate triggerCV also*

** 13/11

Note that trigger will always be slow as we _just_ process the buffer in audio.c - not LIVE...

Working on *VOSIM_SC* versionings - trigin could also be seperate timer/counter - controlled by? - Impulse.ar - LFUGens.cpp

- need to organise parameters for VOSIM as so far we don't do decay

- writepos always given and returned so we can sync

- single VOSIM - until it ends, how is triggered? - but this is just SC triggering

*** notes

- do impulse.ar in vosim, but also like random triger variant that we have

VOSIM_SC:

*ar (trig: 0.1, freq: 400, nCycles: 1, decay: 0.9, mul: 1, add: 0)
Arguments:
trig [ar kr] starts a vosim pulse when a transition from non-positive to positive occurs and no other vosim is still going. audio rate input will produce sample accurate triggering.
freq [ar kr] the frequency of the squared sinewave.
nCycles	- the number of squared sinewaves to use in one vosim pulse. nCycles gets checked when VOSIM receives a trigger.
decay - the decay factor.

eg. http://doc.sccode.org/Classes/VOSIM.html

*do away with END and use as 3rd parameter - eg. in phonemes do we even use 2nd par?*DONE

*TODO: rationalise phonemes so there are 64 or is probability table - also order in which they are arranged could follow probability of transitions...*DONE

** 15/11

Different voices:

Note in Klatt: The facility to use a sampled natural excitation
waveform has been implemented. Naturalness of the resulting synthetic
speech can be greatly improved by using the glottal excitation
waveform from a natural speaker, especially if it is the speaker on
whose voice the synthesis is actually based. This may be obtained
indirectly by inverse-filtering a vowel.

HOW? - this function is in different klatt: [[file:~/Downloads/www.laps.ufpa.br/aldebaro/classes/04procvoz1sem/Klatts/Klatt-C-Windows-F0flutter/Src/parwave.cpp::/*]]

but we could use incoming samples as this? inverse filtering?

Take a recorded vowel and locate the overall peaks and valleys in the spectrum (the formants) by using an LPC (linear predictive coding) algorithm

These peaks and valleys, at least theoretically, should represent the resonances in the mouth caused by a given tongue shape

Use this information to reconstruct the voicing signal (the source) without those peaks and valleys

This is accomplished by inverse-filtering the signal with the LPC, raising the parts of the spectrum which the LPC says are low, and lowering the parts which the LPC says are high. The end result, ideally, will be the source signal as if the person had no vocal tract at all.

http://doc.sccode.org/Classes/LPCAnalyzer.html

but inverse filter?

[[file:~/projects/ERD_modules/worm/lpc.c::FILE........:%20lpc.c][file:~/projects/ERD_modules/worm/lpc.c::FILE........: lpc.c]]

Klatt:Flutter is one of few globals?

also NATURAL and IMPULSIVE in def_pars.c to test as is always now set to impulsive

now klatt_params - see also http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/plab/guestwiki/index.php?title=Klatt_Synthesizer_Parameters

*** TODO

- x/y bandpass - which ones in DI? ABOVE

- vocoder/s - see ABOVE

- alt speech synths listed ABOVE

- klatt LPC stuff

- finish making/remaking phoneme list in klatt/run_holmes above and re-check if runs off/how to re-start or does that happen now?

/////

- raw klatt and other wormings....

- phoneme probabilities (n-grams) and all TODO above!

** 16/11

- added resync on mode change - to TEST all

- phoneme list rewrite based on probabilities so now 64 phonemes

- started on robo/tts - compiles so far but need to know how phonemes are represented - by way of list and stops/numerals etc... TODO!

phonemesToData(textp,s_phonemes)

*** TODO:

- howmany written should depend on readspeed [note: that we can also
  break down klatt frame into smaller chunks as long as we buffer and
  keep track of these in an array]

- Klatt elements - new definitions, other voices eg. whisper, croak, female?

also X= change parameter, Y select parameter - need list and constraints see klatt_params - also this will use code in holmes.c

notes: klattsyn.py, new python code in downloads


*** phoneme probabilities 

phoneme_prob.py

using rsynth-2.0 printing phonemes from
/root/projects/earthcode/worm/beddoesvol1gosse_trimmed we can lose a
few phonemes and re-order as:

u8 phoneme_prob_remap[64]={1, 46, 30, 5, 7, 6, 21, 15, 14, 16, 25, 40, 43, 53, 47, 29, 52, 48, 20, 34, 33, 59, 32, 31, 28, 62, 44, 9, 8, 10, 54, 11, 13, 12, 3, 2, 4, 50, 23, 49, 56, 58, 57, 63, 24, 22, 17, 19, 18, 61, 39, 26, 45, 37, 36, 51, 38, 60, 65, 64, 35, 68, 61, 62}

** 17/11

DONE:

- end removed and replace as SELZ
- mdavocoder working but could do with some tuning - try other vocoders too!
- ladpsa vocoder running
- basic bandpass running with X/Y code - seems work fine. maybe extend with extra formantsTODO...

- pick vowel formants using doformant - TODO: cross-fade to smooth out, use own carriers

also more formants at: https://github.com/supercollider-quarks/Vowel/blob/master/Vowel.sc

need to remember how to convert db and bw!

- formlet code = FOF - see also: http://composerprogrammer.com/teaching/supercollider/sctutorial/12.2%20Singing%20Voice%20Synthesis.html

need to be able to change frequency

SAM working but only with arrays in RAM - not CCMdata or FLASH -????

do we need to init like:

const unsigned char flags[81]  __attribute__ ((section (".flash")))={
with [81]???? TRY!

*** Notes:

BPFSC and BBandpass would operate as fixed and this is what we have already so leave for now
with doformant - somehow need to figure out offset and mix for this for kind of singing - multiple voices/oscillators

Also seems like common to some effects that we would have oscillator/noise etc. triggered?

for SAM: http://www.retrobits.net/atari/sam.shtml

*** TODO: - PRIORITISE: changes/TODO as above and all tests

- possibilities of vocoding with buffer generated audio

*- Borsboom/zerius vocoder in earthvoice2 dir to look at*

- mdavoc.c is wierd for carrier source

- look at propellor/cordic thing for worm tract simulation

- klatt as singing - constant sounds?

- different voices in sam.c - parameter live altering, speed of sam, lookup array for phonemes

- trigger/schedule for one word/phrase after the other

- pull audio-bufsz back up from 32768

** 18-19/11

- done lpc.c (talkie) - but triggering - always issue with free-running round in buffer overwrites itself

- using encoder - calc.m and romgen from talkie with freemat and online convertor - use 8 KHz 16 bit mono recordings to encode words for lpc.c

- Formant object also in SC - done

** TODO

- wormlpc (but there in analysis phase also see sc live stuff),
  wormvoice simulation, how to do crossfading - need run 2 filters

- increase LPC vocabulary - pointers to flash works or not?

- *triggering and scheduling on all*

- braids code only for worming

- Borsboom vocoder to port to static memory allocation [vocoder added and compiles/runs but not result and slows incoming audio]

- LPC live analysis = [[file:~/sc3-plugins/source/NCAnalysisUGens/LPCAnalyzer.cpp::/*]]

*Think about* - mixing of round-buffer and live(where is no speed),
scheduling questions always... eg. vosim is more in live audio.c than
round buffer and others other way round...


** 20/11

- vocoder fixed (was sqr in fft_mag) - without overlap and would be nice to try different carriers
(check also timing in interrupt? - done and seems okay so far)

- started on [[file:lpcanalysissc.c::*%20LPCAnalysis.h][file:lpcanalysissc.c::* LPCAnalysis.h]] - just rough filling in so far

- braids for worming: [[file:braidworm.c::/%20vosim/vowel/vowelfof][file:braidworm.c::/ vosim/vowel/vowelfof]] - again filling in - also we need dsp from stmlib!

** 22/11

NOTES: phoneme_prob_other is used for our phoneme probabilities on
laptop/NOT worm with say.c modified in rsynth-2.0 as marked with xxxxx

- modded just to print selected phonemes (what was scheme which was just their number as in Elements.def?), and re-modded just to say these phonemes

- but conversion of text to phoneme using say.c repeats sections? -
  FIXED but should do 2 versions of say and co, also vague fullstop
  business 

TO FIX: // fullstops // 2 versions // readable phonemes

TODO: 

- summary for each mode so far and each TODO

- how klatt frame size relates to each change in parameters - where we need to intersect for raw klatt? nsynth -> parwave?

"Each frame of parameters usually represents 10ms of output speech. Two
(simple!) example parameter files are supplied with the package."

at 32000 samples per sec 10ms=320 samples - in def_pars.c we have 8ms per frame = 256 samples

see also: http://www.asel.udel.edu/speech/tutorials/production/gensyn.htm

[- pull rsynth-2.0 into src git]

- port rsynth changes back to darkint voice code

** 23/11

TODO from yesterday TODO

+

finish working through braids, lpcanalysis, vowel.sc, stk above and look at dynklank resonators:

note:

inline float32 zapgremlins(float32 x)
{
	float32 absx = std::abs(x);
	// very small numbers fail the first test, eliminating denormalized numbers
	//    (zero also fails the first test, but that is OK since it returns zero.)
	// very large numbers fail the second test, eliminating infinities
	// Not-a-Numbers fail both tests and are eliminated.
	return (absx > (float32)1e-15 && absx < (float32)1e15) ? x : (float32)0.;

+ mul in SC portings? and db and bw in vowel parameters - how we did this for doformant

+ const arrays of vocal filter parameters eg. for klank resonators

+ basic LPC to try out

// so break down to:

1- new experiments/code as above
2- summary and tweaking of what modes we have so far: basic excitation osc generation, fixed filters stored
3- scheduling and triggering schemes overall...
4- towards manual

* 3/12

TRM parameters see: http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~hill/papers/synthesizer/body.html

TRM Notes:

- At 32k samples we have 96k samples for 12 sets of parameters in input (so 96/12=8k per set)

- Basic parameters and then frame parameters

- What is set with calloc and can it be set as array/not dynamic?

wavetable can be static allocated (is only rewritten if source is pulse)

number of taps is calculated in init of filter

    FIRData = (float *)calloc(numberTaps, sizeof(float)); // TODO as fixed?
    FIRCoef = (float *)calloc(numberTaps, sizeof(float));

  return ((INPUT *)malloc(sizeof(INPUT))); // TODO? - from addinput? 

this is inputtable which is each parameter frame/set +1???? so if we have fixed number of parameter sets??? we can fix this...

* 4/12

- TRM tube.c init_parameters but still need get rid of dynamic memory - we just have one input-table (+1=2) so thats 8k samples into audio_buffer
