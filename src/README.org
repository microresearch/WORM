* ERD?WORM dirty speech synth

32k sample rate

* TODO

- sort out memory allocations
- basics of read/write head and speech integration
- tests for each speech function/mode
- vocoder and how we deal with buffers?
- integrate/test/new knob allocations

* progress

** 4/11/2015

- stripped code and it compiles

** 9-10/11/2015

- knobs left/right from top (pcb and lach=test) = 0/mode-(2..3)
1/selX.egX-(3..2) 2/speed-(0..4) 3/end-(4..1)
4/trigthresh/vocoderfreq/othersel.eg/selY-(1..0)

- input=threshold/vocoder_voice

- question of scheduling: examples? trigger_to_sync needs to be in reading in code (and trigger say new phoneme)

what is framesize for audio=32 x u16, and how frames work for speech/klatt

- list modes and examples: 0/klatt 1/vosim 2/x-y filter 3/LPC 4/vocoder 5/klatt screwed

- what are other speech synth??? LIST from earthvoice2:

PropTermialTract: propellor assembly
robo: arduino 
sam: It is an adaption to C of the speech software SAM (Software Automatic Mouth) for the Commodore C64
SAMarduino: arduino of SAM above
Talkie-LPCcode: :LPC
tinySAM.c: small SAM above
Tiny Speech Synth: C code
TTS: as robo above

other: cantarino, 


*This week to have basic scheduling for klatt and knob allocations, memory. Also kind of template for other generators*

W/T/F
