* ERD/WORM dirty speech synth

32k sample rate->48k?

*we always need transition from previous phoneme for each mode (inc X/Y)!* - this can also be faked/transition in phoneme itself

* modes

*MODE | IS? | FILES/DIR | BASED_ON | NOTES/TODO - to add to TODO from below*

0-   | klatt single phoneme | klatt in rsynth | rsynth-2.0-port | single phoneme needs transition always to make sense

but this can be done with transition/pitch etc. in each phoneme - what
are these changing elements - write to parfile... make thus larger phoneme list

collate klatt/holmes notes below which also mention this!

again how long is each frame, how many frames per phoneme, how to
simplify figuring out transitions and also calls to init...

//at 32000 samples per sec 10ms=320 samples - in def_pars.c we have 8ms per frame = 256 samples//

1-   | klatt chain of phonemes | klatt |rsynth-2.0-port | 

klatt always needs next phoneme so what to do if no next is signalled
(repeat or loop through list as determined)?

also updating klatt phoneme might cause glitch in audio if we do it in
audio.c // so larger/main buffer=special case perhaps as mode 0

- this becomes two modes: cycling phonemes and simplified klatt//wormed klatt

2-   | SC-VOSIM | vosim.c | SC | one of these is free running???
3-   | SC-VOSIM? | vosim.c  | SC | 
4-   | MDA_VOCODER | mdavoc.c | MDA? | excitation is also there? 
5-   | LADSPA VOCODER | vocode.c | ladspa | 
6-   | SELX/Y FILTERS |  | | choose/check which bandpass
7-   | doformantfilter-few vowels | effect.c | none | try different bandpass/move between vowels/more formants 
8-   | formlet | effect.c | SC | 
9-   | SAM | sam.c | sam.c??? |
10-  | LPC/Talkie | LPC/lpc.c  | talkie |  larger vocabulary  
11-  | SC formant | scformant.c  | SC | is sine working properly? 
12-  | borboom vocoder | vocoder/vocode.c | borboom | try with ARM FFT - do we serial conn. to check FFT?
13-  | rendervosim | braidworm.c | braids - [[file:~/projects/ERD_modules/older/eurorack/braids/digital_oscillator.cc]] | needs worming not to use straight 
14-  | rendervowel | braidworm.c | braids | 
15-  | rendervowelfof | braidworm.c | braids | 
16-  | lpcanalyzer | lpcanalysiss.c  | SC | 
17-  | voicform | voicform.c  | STK | 
18-  | tubesim | tube.c | TRM | 

towards maximum 32 modes! cut vocoders to basic/working with swopped excitation/voice input

cut other modes to focus on:

- TRM/tubes
- Klatt
- LPC
- vocoder

** klatt notes

*** working through rsynth-2.0 5/1/2016

- "eh" is 18 frames = 180 mS (we have this with silence)...

double mSec_per_frame = 10; 8000 is sample rate...

- holmes is where frames are interpolated from phonemes/element list:

nEparm is number of parameters in each frame

holmes runs  parwave_init(&klatt_global) and        parwave(&klatt_global, &pars, samp) for each frame...

parwave in nsynth.c ->    CONVERT FRAME OF PARAMETER DATA TO A WAVEFORM CHUNK

for our single phonemes in code HERE we run:
PhonemeToWaveData(phoneme,1, 0) -> say.c which is trimmed to take
phoneme code and then run:

wav_len = holmes(3, intern,max_samples, pWavBuffer	);

which brings us back into single phoneme/transition issue - as will
always transition to Q then END and both are null

- what is first line of Elements.def for each phoneme eg...: {"DZ",  26, 1, 1,0x64,"d","d",alv|stp|vcd, ->

typedef struct Elm_s
 {
  char *name;
  char rk; - dominance of element
  char du; - dur/
  char ud; - dur/
  unsigned char font; ???
  char  *dict;
  char  *ipa;
  long  feat;
  interp_t p[nEparm];
 } Elm_t, *Elm_ptr;

and then each parameter has list

 {float stdy;
  float fixd;
  char  prop;
  char  ed;
  char  id;

- stdy, fixd, prop// used for transitions /// ed=, id= ext or int times???

- duration is 6 for example: ./say "eh" -v -l test.raw -p test.par - so 6 frames for E,Q-null,END-null

- how would it sound if we have no transitions - klatt and pyklatt/klsyn: -> simpler klatt without interpolation

- see klsyn (restrictions on commercial use) also for synthesis from
  base parameters - also new parameters - to test this out but seems bit cumbersome...

- for klatt we use: ./klatt -i example1.par -r 2 -s 8000 -o test.raw and:

 play -t raw --bits 16 --channels 1 --encoding signed-integer --rate 8000 test.raw

with examples as list of parameters 

figure out also how klatts and online parwave.c differ from local klatt // latest rsynth also

http://show.docjava.com/book/cgij/code/data/lectures/cr310/DSP/chapter%205/711/klatt/parwave.c

http://homepages.wmich.edu/~hillenbr/klsyn/klsyn.txt

- nvp.c half through porting is also a much simpler klatt... tho ipa.py makes it a bit more complex

*** what are global varyings for klatt:

- from command line options: flutter, base F0, tilt db, msec per
  frame, number of formants in cascade - but default is parallel, impulse glottal source bool // holmes =
  -S <d> [1] Speed (1.0 is 'normal') -K <lg> [1] Parameter filter
  'fraction'

- for example we can vary base (as top in holmes) dynamically, also values like duration we can alter

- in rsynth: def_pars.c (what is pars.def for? - is default frame definition)

long samp_rate = 32000;

void init_synth(void)
{
	//double mSec_per_frame = 10;
  float mSec_per_frame = 8; // 10?
	//int impulse = 0;
	int impulse = 1;
	//int casc = 1;
	int casc = 2;
	klatt_global.samrate = samp_rate;
	klatt_global.quiet_flag = TRUE;
	klatt_global.glsource = NATURAL;// IMPULSIVE doesn't work - but is set below!
	klatt_global.f0_flutter = 0;

	//	klatt_global.quiet_flag, "Quiet - minimal messages",
	//	impulse,                 "Impulse glottal source",
	//	casc,                    "Number cascade formants",
	//	klatt_global.f0_flutter, "F0 flutter",
	//	mSec_per_frame,         "mSec per frame",
	//	def_pars.TLTdb,          "Tilt dB",
	//	def_pars.F0hz10,         "Base F0 in 0.1Hz",

	if (casc > 0)
	{
		klatt_global.synthesis_model = CASCADE_PARALLEL;
		klatt_global.nfcascade = casc;
	}
	else
		klatt_global.synthesis_model = ALL_PARALLEL;

	if (impulse)
		klatt_global.glsource = IMPULSIVE;

	klatt_global.nspfr = (klatt_global.samrate * mSec_per_frame) / 1000;
}

- and rsynth in docs:

 double mSec_per_frame = 10;
 int impulse = 0;
 int casc = 0;
 klatt_global.samrate = samp_rate;
 klatt_global.quiet_flag = TRUE;
 klatt_global.glsource = NATURAL;
 klatt_global.f0_flutter = 0;

- NATURAL changes impulses but in doc/klatt code we have natural
  sampled source - but doesn't work - option is 2 - fixed as SAMPLE_FACTOR was very small - mult * 2.0

*** other notes

- in mage video - wheel for repeating phoneme loop selection to maybe implement // how this could work?

- so klatt mode should just be that looping and maybe a stripped or
  reduced klatt without transitions as a seperate mode with more changes in pitch and so on

- TODO: nsp.c port - ipa.py questions, test generation of klsyn/klatt
  parameters from simple code, does rsynth sound same on worm or do we
  have samplerate issues - play also with various defines (see above)DONE/// port that simple klatt

example1.par: 40 params

1000 0 543 0 1324 0 2663 0 3681 0 4279 0 4000 0 0 0 200 40  0 40  0 20  0  0  0 52  0 57  0 72  0 67  0 80  0 80  0  0  0 70

// see genparam.c - what are important ones, how they depend on each other esp. F0 and nopen/T0 timings:

    /* T0 is 4* the number of samples in one pitch period */

    globals->T0 = (40 * globals->samrate) / frame->F0hz10;

and nopen (=4x Kopen in the frame) cannot be > T0

// in our test case samrate is 8000 so x40=320,000 / F0hz which starts at 1000 = less than 320 /4 for kopen=80

also case with Kskew to figure out... so need to implement these constraints

*** collated from below TODO

** own speech synth: worm.c

- also what are differences between chips such as sp0256/votrax - (see patents)

Following klatt:

- excitation - voiced/unvoiced, changes in frequency of glottal pulses, white noise...
- filtering - formants and zero poles (nasal), any tube modelling,
  open and close of mouth - see latest book

* worming

- wormbounds x/y exerted on parameters + speed of worming z?
- worm trigger?

** xxx

*This week to have basic scheduling for klatt and knob allocations, memory. Also kind of template for other generators*

*template should be triggerable version and free-running version - mark each as such!*

** 11/11

- can we have say 128k contig memory? can use say 120k but need to assign memory to ccm if need more than 8k for other tasks

but not enuff memory in that case and can't program it (look for
larger arrays?) - set now to 32768 so can do loggy as is and can
always change loggy

will need to look into stm32_flash.ld for ccm definition - TESTed okayyyy....

eg. u16 sin_data[256] __attribute__ ((section (".ccmdata")));  // sine LUT Array

FIXED 12/11

- stmlib => fft etc. ???

so we put eg.  int16_t pWavBuffer[3840] __attribute__ ((section (".ccmdata")));

// testing now basics - why is so quiet?

// parwave is in nsynth - this handles the klatt frames

*** final 11/11 notes

- need to break down phoneme frames and/or move phoneme generation out
  of audio.c interrupt as is too long/slow - also as if we re-trigger
  fast then is only start of phoneme we hear...

  moved out of interrupt which means we have 32 samples/trigger always issue (so is 32 samples max slowed)- seems okay now

- to test all phonemes... also still question of volume to solve - HW on test board?

[- enter_phonemes() in phtoelm is executed only once? and can we bypass
  this for individual phonemes? or is case of phoneme and last one?]

/// all of rsynth is about transitions between phonemes and we just
have one - so simplify or fake this/make longer phoneme cases. see holmes.c

/BUT/and our list of phonemes is the lookup list - to figure out what we
need to send to holmes for 2nd part and simplify holmes for 1 phoneme 12/11
or do X/Y of 2 phonemes - but what of trigger? or trigger on max!

either way simplify to numericals an no string stuff/memory 

- klatt/rsynth on pc verbose to check all...-> see Downloads/rsynth-2.0 (also updated rsynth version?)

- TODO: raw klatt with certain start positions and worm off from these within parameter bounds for each

- TODO: generate and test square for vocoder

** 12/11

- fixed stm32_flash.ld CCM mistake

- retest trigger - fixed as VOLATILE

- break down rsynth - problem is if we even have 1 phoneme + stress then is ended!

so we need to open up holmes.c so keeps running and writes directly
into audio_buffer and deals with trigger/phoneme selection (is always
one phoneme behind? - but not great idea as we can't look ahead?

how do we get stress and dur from phoneme?

this is dur in phone_to_elm

if (!(p->feat & vwl))
stress = 0;
t += phone_append(elm,StressDur(p,stress));
(int) (StressDur(p, stress, islong)));
#define StressDur(e,s,l) ((e->ud + (e->du - e->ud) * s / 3)*speed)

for each one in elements.def

next bit is stress?

stress is either 0,1,2 or 3

so we have phoneme_num//dur//stress and 1/6/0 seems to be ending (twice??) *TODO* make that array which is test_elm

- also need to get rid of pwavebuffer and write straight IN DONE

- 32k=64k=128 frames

- can enlarge audio buffer now we have fixed ccm so could be 60k =
  120k = say 200 frames audio.h = 58870 with log_gen.py calculating
  end

*if we enlarge then re-do loggy for this size* DONE

*69 is number of phonetic elements - stress or no stress = 69x4=272 - close to 255???* leave stress as 0 for now

*** notes

- how does CV select phoneme - like how often do we sample CV to give
phoneme? do we have phoneme list which we run through into buffer and
shift out or? based on speed? as have it trigger is the one

- working on run_holmes which is constant running and trigger-able -
  test this and then figure out how to update list... 

- clip in nsynth *4.0f for volume increase ADDED - VOLUME fixed

- still scheduling question - say for run_holmes so doesn't just cycle
  over itself... wait until playhead passes how?

// and run_holmes seem start with phrase fine and run DOWN - if we run continuous then will tail off!

- run_holmes as 2nd mode (MODE=1)

- how does run_holmes know how much to fill buffer? - overfill?/average - silence is ok

*** TODO

- triggering and scheduling is main issue// add to end of phoneme list and shift left or just re-write (more modes?)re-write!-TODO

- mode1-run_holmes - use trigger to freeze any changes to phoneme list as extra mode-TODO

*TODO: proof tests on VOSIM(sc/braids/csound/sc-formlets),XY(bbandpass,doformantfilter, biquad), vocoder(ladspa?/mdavoc=input and
mdavocoder?/mdatalkbox/pv_vocoder=justFFTsofar), LPC(talkie and SC), canto etc.* nearly DONE

*TODO: changes suggested above//how to test-simulate triggerCV also*

** 13/11

Note that trigger will always be slow as we _just_ process the buffer in audio.c - not LIVE...

Working on *VOSIM_SC* versionings - trigin could also be seperate timer/counter - controlled by? - Impulse.ar - LFUGens.cpp

- need to organise parameters for VOSIM as so far we don't do decay

- writepos always given and returned so we can sync

- single VOSIM - until it ends, how is triggered? - but this is just SC triggering

*** notes

- do impulse.ar in vosim, but also like random triger variant that we have

VOSIM_SC:

*ar (trig: 0.1, freq: 400, nCycles: 1, decay: 0.9, mul: 1, add: 0)
Arguments:
trig [ar kr] starts a vosim pulse when a transition from non-positive to positive occurs and no other vosim is still going. audio rate input will produce sample accurate triggering.
freq [ar kr] the frequency of the squared sinewave.
nCycles	- the number of squared sinewaves to use in one vosim pulse. nCycles gets checked when VOSIM receives a trigger.
decay - the decay factor.

eg. http://doc.sccode.org/Classes/VOSIM.html

*do away with END and use as 3rd parameter - eg. in phonemes do we even use 2nd par?*DONE

*TODO: rationalise phonemes so there are 64 or is probability table - also order in which they are arranged could follow probability of transitions...*DONE

** 15/11

Different voices:

Note in Klatt: The facility to use a sampled natural excitation
waveform has been implemented. Naturalness of the resulting synthetic
speech can be greatly improved by using the glottal excitation
waveform from a natural speaker, especially if it is the speaker on
whose voice the synthesis is actually based. This may be obtained
indirectly by inverse-filtering a vowel.

HOW? - this function is in different klatt: [[file:~/Downloads/www.laps.ufpa.br/aldebaro/classes/04procvoz1sem/Klatts/Klatt-C-Windows-F0flutter/Src/parwave.cpp::/*]]

but we could use incoming samples as this? inverse filtering?

Take a recorded vowel and locate the overall peaks and valleys in the spectrum (the formants) by using an LPC (linear predictive coding) algorithm

These peaks and valleys, at least theoretically, should represent the resonances in the mouth caused by a given tongue shape

Use this information to reconstruct the voicing signal (the source) without those peaks and valleys

This is accomplished by inverse-filtering the signal with the LPC, raising the parts of the spectrum which the LPC says are low, and lowering the parts which the LPC says are high. The end result, ideally, will be the source signal as if the person had no vocal tract at all.

http://doc.sccode.org/Classes/LPCAnalyzer.html

but inverse filter?

SAM working but only with arrays in RAM - not CCMdata or FLASH -????

do we need to init like:

const unsigned char flags[81]  __attribute__ ((section (".flash")))={
with [81]???? TRY!

*** Notes:

BPFSC and BBandpass would operate as fixed and this is what we have already so leave for now
with doformant - somehow need to figure out offset and mix for this for kind of singing - multiple voices/oscillators

Also seems like common to some effects that we would have oscillator/noise etc. triggered?

for SAM: http://www.retrobits.net/atari/sam.shtml

*** TODO: - PRIORITISE: changes/TODO as above and all tests

- possibilities of vocoding with buffer generated audio

*- Borsboom/zerius vocoder in earthvoice2 dir to look at*

- mdavoc.c is wierd for carrier source

- look at propellor/cordic thing for worm tract simulation

- klatt as singing - constant sounds?

** 18-19/11

- done lpc.c (talkie) - but triggering - always issue with free-running round in buffer overwrites itself

- using encoder - calc.m and romgen from talkie with freemat and online convertor - use 8 KHz 16 bit mono recordings to encode words for lpc.c

- Formant object also in SC - done

** TODO

- wormlpc (but there in analysis phase also see sc live stuff),
  wormvoice simulation, how to do crossfading - need run 2 filters

- increase LPC vocabulary - pointers to flash works or not?

- *triggering and scheduling on all*

- braids code only for worming

- Borsboom vocoder to port to static memory allocation [vocoder added and compiles/runs but not result and slows incoming audio]

- LPC live analysis = [[file:~/sc3-plugins/source/NCAnalysisUGens/LPCAnalyzer.cpp::/*]]

*Think about* - mixing of round-buffer and live(where is no speed),
scheduling questions always... eg. vosim is more in live audio.c than
round buffer and others other way round...


** 20/11

- vocoder fixed (was sqr in fft_mag) - without overlap and would be nice to try different carriers
(check also timing in interrupt? - done and seems okay so far)

- started on [[file:lpcanalysissc.c::*%20LPCAnalysis.h][file:lpcanalysissc.c::* LPCAnalysis.h]] - just rough filling in so far

- braids for worming: [[file:braidworm.c::/%20vosim/vowel/vowelfof][file:braidworm.c::/ vosim/vowel/vowelfof]] - again filling in - also we need dsp from stmlib!

and Vowel.SC there!

along with Formants and BPFstack (multiples of Formant we have and BPF) which could be adapted also for these vowel lists.

how vowels compare with braids?

NOTES: phoneme_prob_other is used for our phoneme probabilities on
laptop/NOT worm with say.c modified in rsynth-2.0 as marked with xxxxx

- modded just to print selected phonemes (what was scheme which was just their number as in Elements.def?), and re-modded just to say these phonemes

- but conversion of text to phoneme using say.c repeats sections? -
  FIXED but should do 2 versions of say and co, also vague fullstop
  business 

TO FIX: // fullstops // 2 versions // readable phonemes

TODO: 

- summary for each mode so far and each TODO

- how klatt frame size relates to each change in parameters - where we need to intersect for raw klatt? nsynth -> parwave?

"Each frame of parameters usually represents 10ms of output speech. Two
(simple!) example parameter files are supplied with the package."

at 32000 samples per sec 10ms=320 samples - in def_pars.c we have 8ms per frame = 256 samples

finish working through braids, lpcanalysis, vowel.sc, stk above and look at dynklank resonators:

note:

inline float32 zapgremlins(float32 x)
{
	float32 absx = std::abs(x);
	// very small numbers fail the first test, eliminating denormalized numbers
	//    (zero also fails the first test, but that is OK since it returns zero.)
	// very large numbers fail the second test, eliminating infinities
	// Not-a-Numbers fail both tests and are eliminated.
	return (absx > (float32)1e-15 && absx < (float32)1e15) ? x : (float32)0.;
}

- Define as TEST in Makefile - audio.c for DARKINT test board -  also as worm.brd output is on LEFT
not on RIGHT!

- Programmer header is straight to STLINK rather than swop we have in DARKINT

*** Software

- braids - compiled and working - just need to tweak parameter ranges... and WORM out as is too clean (esp... RenderVowel)
also if we can use square etc. as excitation?

-lpcanalysis - compiles and seems to work from SC - need more exciters...

Notes:

dataEmpty: Converts available portion of the input signal to the new sampling
rate, and outputs the samples to the sound struct.

buffer is 1024,,,, functions: flushbuffer, datafill , *dataempty writes to temp file*...

*** TODO still:

- play with TRM/tube on PC - worm simulation - width of mouth/nose???? DONE
- implement generic wavetables, envelopes etc. for excitations and how might work with buffer
- TRM portings DONE

** 3/12

TRM Notes:

- At 32k samples we have 96k samples for 12 sets of parameters in input (so 96/12=8k per set)

- Basic parameters and then frame parameters

- What is set with calloc and can it be set as array/not dynamic?

wavetable can be static allocated (is only rewritten if source is pulse)

number of taps is calculated in init of filter

    FIRData = (float *)calloc(numberTaps, sizeof(float)); // TODO as fixed?
    FIRCoef = (float *)calloc(numberTaps, sizeof(float));

  return ((INPUT *)malloc(sizeof(INPUT))); // TODO? - from addinput? 

this is inputtable which is each parameter frame/set +1???? so if we have fixed number of parameter sets??? we can fix this...

fixed as max size for both FIR??? could overflow

** 4/12

- TRM tube.c init_parameters but still need get rid of dynamic
  memory - we just have one input-table (+1=2) so thats 8k samples
  into audio_buffer (leave dynamic as filter needs)// tableone and tabletwo

- how do we know when phrase/frame is done? to avoid overwriting? is just one call to synthesize?

- crashes so far in: dataEmpty!FIXED - double initialisation as we
  initialize in main: initializeSynthesizer();// includes call to
  init_parameters !!!! TUBE.C - TRM! and was 0.0 for volume in first of frames from input

- could simplify the linked list as we just have 2 frames (1+interpolation) TODO!

*** TODO: 

- that we could have several different base vocal tract modes for TRM
  -> parameter_list or use SELY/SELZ to vary the main parameters as
  below.

- trim working modes // run thru - also twin buffers - switch vocoder voice/excitation etc...

** 5/12

- list of TRM parameters

TRM parameters see: http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~hill/papers/synthesizer/body.html

we have for each frame:

	glotPitch = strtod(ptr, &ptr);
	glotVol = strtod(ptr, &ptr);
	aspVol = strtod(ptr, &ptr);
	fricVol = strtod(ptr, &ptr);
	fricPos = strtod(ptr, &ptr);
	fricCF = strtod(ptr, &ptr);
	fricBW = strtod(ptr, &ptr);
	for (i = 0; i < TOTAL_REGIONS; i++) // 8 values
	    radius[i] = strtod(ptr, &ptr);
	velum = strtod(ptr, &ptr); // last value

in [[file:~/Downloads/gnuspeech-0.9/Applications/Monet/samples/diphones.degas]] we have:

///

So microint and pitch?

[[file:~/Downloads/gnuspeech-0.9/Applications/TRAcT/tube.c]] is same as our tube model...

  nyquist/samplerate which is determined by tube length?

solutions as length and pitch is what we want to vary = pitch should
be fine live, and have set of tables for different tube lengths as above

but still need to clean up linked list, how to add new frames and so
on, also how that change in glotPitch works with interpolation?

- tested CV hardware all fine // switched round in audio.h (on x60 so
  transfer here), need tweaks for resonance (could be selz?) on X/Y
  filter, also ifdef switch for INPUT also in audio.c and maybe try other bandpass?

- or SELZ for x/y filter can scale both formants for size of throat/voice

- effect.c x/Y filter should be in parallel, amplification and varying Q for each? use of example vowels???

how again to convert bandwidth to Q: 

~bpOctavesToRq = { arg octaves; (pow(2, octaves) - 1) / pow(2, octaves).sqrt }; // appears wrong way round!!

say 130 hz for x, 70 hz for y?

find formant table from SC again: Vowel.sc definitions: [[file:~/projects/earthvoice2/Vowel/Vowel.sc]]

eg. 			.put( 'a', 'soprano', 'freq',[ 800, 1150, 2900, 3900, 4950 ])
			.put( 'a', 'soprano', 'db', [ 0, -6, -32, -20, -50 ])
			.put( 'a', 'soprano', 'bw',	 [ 80, 90, 120, 130, 140 ])

but what is bw, how relates to Q, and dbamp... but these seem to work with BBandPass as evidenced by below...

- how we do db amp? but more how this becomes x and y scalings with bandwidth????

bw also goes up as freq goes up...

- not much further with votrax.c - sounds produced but timing/length
  of phonemes from ROM doesn't come close to match data
  sheet/unintelligble speech

and: https://batchloaf.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/ugly-speech-synthesis-in-c/

- how to use what we have from votrax - break out parameters

speech chips- ti99=talkie DONE?/ SP0256 by Joseph Zbiciak-above in MAME but not free/ TMS5200-above?/ VOTRAX SC01-????// speakjet?

csound- vowgen:   // only find [[file:~/projects/ERD_modules/worm/docs/Csound6.05/Opcodes/fm4op.c]] which is like voices/voicform noted above

** 4/1

*** rethinking hardware design

- check if noise is there on in/out which causes X/Y filter strangeness

- maybe different solution for CV inputs?

- hardware encoder for main mode?

*** software and plan

- 48k as new sample rate? or?

- finish portings=nvaccess????///31/12 list above// run thru all in docs and discard

- break down to excitation (buffer) // tract/processing/speech (buffer) // incoming (buffer)

- test code different excitations - list here: white noise/gaussian etc, pulses, vosim/decaying sines, square/triangle // what else?

- collate all vowel/phoneme parameters and control parameters in one
  place (and any conversions between these eg. Q and bandwidth, amp
  and db): put in collated_forms.h - but we need to figure out
  conversions, how we made these in the past, and also what works for bandpass:

bandpass options: bandpassx/y(owl), bandpasses in SC=BBandPass/BPFSC, doformantfilter=arm_biquad (init only), 

- do we need voiced/unvoiced and pitch detection... also incoming LPC

- coherent modular solution for _all_ generation - howmuchneeded,
  trigger generation and testing, all processing in audio.c, main for
  changes

- own worm speech synth algo...

- vocoder needs much work... what do we have so far? see also: http://gurzil.livejournal.com/15375.html and pvsvoc in csound code.

** TODO

- X/Y with different bandpass tests

- retest arm_biquad _without_ mult in co-efficients...

- debug messages in klatt for holmes/interpolation/stresses to figure
  out how to manipulate single phonemes - but these are never single...

- klatt question is always what is NEXT phoneme - if there isn't one (loop a list of phonemes) list->end then repeat

** 5/1

- modes at top of this doc, and structured working through of klatt/rsynth also above - porting of nvp.c to test

- have a look at: [[file:~/projects/ERD_modules/worm/docs/mage/src/mage.cpp::/*%20This%20file%20is%20part%20of%20MAGE%20/%20pHTS(%20the%20performative%20HMM-based%20speech%20synthesis%20system%20)%20*/][file:~/projects/ERD_modules/worm/docs/mage/src/mage.cpp::/* This file is part of MAGE / pHTS( the performative HMM-based speech synthesis system ) */]]

which also has vocoder code...

** 6/1 - 7/1 ++

TODO: 

1/port simple klatt and add constraints (test first on laptop->see genparam.cDONE): simpleklatt.c DONE- to test

2/round phonemes for klatt in mainbuffer simply - x/y position/change - speed of revolution and end-length calc/hit end of

3/finish port and test nvp.c: ipa.py calculates: phoneme times/duration->frameDuration,fadeDuration, pitch

see also: test_midiSing.py and hannah:

def queueFrame(self,frame,minFrameDuration,fadeDuration,userIndex=-1,purgeQueue=False):

player.queueFrame(frame,//frame=120,fade=100)

// how that translates to samplecount at samplerate=? test this and fade is fade across frame parameters?

// other globals eg. 	_curPitch=118
	_curVoice='Adam'
	_curInflection=0.5
	_curVolume=1.0
	_curRate=1.0

TODO: test generating a single frame (laptop?)

4/rest of mame porting

*// but we need clearer idea of buffers  and scheduling... for now just test very basics...*

should be blackbox/generator for each mode which fills buffer in
audio.c (inside workings hidden inc. for klatt/mode 0 roundabout) -
each as function pointer and if needs run in main as scheduler

so we have function pointers eg.

generate_simpleklatt(incoming, outgoing)

first klatt runs round and round in audio_buffer (but only at full
length of all phonemes) and we schedule updates (when/how - at speed of playback)

*also to simplify - where is u16 and so on defined (from something in audio.h), clearer coding style for all underscores etc???*

5/worm.c filled out with ideas

6/look into mage above// questions

** 13/1

- nvp.c working on laptop with phonemes defined - possible here to
  vary across short 32/100 sample frames: interpolation and length of
  phoneme, pitch of phoneme, vibrato, gain and other globals TODO-
  backport to ARM - inits etc.

- also above variations for own worm voice synthesis

** 14/1

- ported back nvp.c but still needs fix for buffer
